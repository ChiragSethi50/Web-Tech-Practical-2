      <h2>Marvel Cinematic Universe — $25.56B</h2>
      <p>
        A franchise that is so far ahead with the box office numbers, that it's<br>
        nearly impossible to take its place. It certainly helps there are 27<br>
        movies in the franchise, but it doesn't mean each of those movies aren't<br>
        indeed commercial successes. From Iron Man in 2008 to Spider-man: No Way<br>
        Home in 2021, the Marvel Cinematic Universe keeps proving there are more<br>
        stories to tell. Even though some are afraid the universe is getting too<br>
        complicated and nonsensical, the $25.56B mark is a sign they won't stop<br>
        anytime soon.

      <h2>Star Wars — $10.31B</h2>
      <p>
        Nine movies grossing over $10.31B and all nominated for the Academy<br> 
        Awards at some point. This is as clear an indication of both critical<br>
        and commercial success as can be. We wonder if it was George Lucas'<br>
        intention to make a pop-cultural phenomenon out of a sci-fi movie,<br>
        something never seen before the 70s. With 3 separate film trilogies and<br>
        another planned trilogy on the way.

      <h2>Spider-man — $9.25B</h2>
      <p>
        It's only recently that the Spider-Man franchise took Harry Potter's<br>
        third place as the highest grossing franchise. It's all thanks to the<br>
        release of the latest Spider-Man: No Way Home movie, which has grossed<br>
        over $1.53 billion worldwide. Although Kevin Feige confirmed that they<br>
        are developing a fourth MCU Spider-Man movie, it's hard to say how it's<br>
        going to work out given the ongoing conflict between Disney and Sony. No<br>
        matter the drama and disputes, Spider-Man still ranks third with over<br>
        $9.25B grossed.

      <h2>Harry Potter — $9.20B</h2>
      <p>
        The success of the Harry Potter book series was a big indicator of how<br>
        the films would do when Warner Bros. decided to develop them. Ten movies<br>
        have managed to gross over $9.20B in the worldwide box office. All four<br>
        directors that worked on the movies (Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón,<br>
        Mike Newell, and David Yates) put their unique spin on the style and the<br>
        storytelling. The Fantastic Beasts is a great spin-off prequel, but we<br>
        would also definitely love to see a series dedicated to the Marauders'<br>
        era at Hogwarts.
