          When's the last time you've had an Italian soda?<br>
          It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my <br>
          friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and<br> 
          I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy <br>
          water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are <br>
          not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a <br>
          flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes <br>
          also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; <br>
          I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop <br>
          alternative for the times when you're feeling a <br>
          refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.<BR>

          Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26.<br> 
          The interiors are done well with a mixture of modern age designing<br>
          with classic old school comfort. The place is divided into three <br>
          areas basically which is the indoor lounge, the outdoor and rooftop seating.<br>
          The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to the restaurant <br>
          where as the outdoor seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and <br>
          funky wall frames. An ideal place to chill and relax.<br>

          I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte,<br>
           only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from.<br> 
          I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste <br>
          like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was<br>
          delicious.

          Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, <br>
          including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage <br>
          before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor <br>
          and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the <br>
          patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
